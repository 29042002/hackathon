# Simple Etherium-based custom digital token example

[This DApp](https://hackathon.ibuildapp.io/examples/3) shows you can issue your own token. It's built with [the official manual](https://www.ethereum.org/token) and demonstrates simple crypto-currecy based on Ethereum's smart contracts.

For this example we've set total amount of 10.000 tokens and this DApp lets you get any amount of these token just by specifying your address in Rinkeby testnet and amount you want. It also allows you to transfer tokens from your to another address and check you balance.
