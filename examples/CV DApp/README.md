# Simple Etherium-based CV DApp example

This app represents simple CV that can be made with smart contract. In this case smart contract keeps all the data and you can simply access it with special methods. Futhermore, you can also add data changing functionality, but bear in mind, such actions cost gas since they change app's state. It's also possible to check whether creator of the app tries to change data or not.

[The app](https://hackathon.ibuildapp.io/examples/2) works in Rinkeby testnet.
